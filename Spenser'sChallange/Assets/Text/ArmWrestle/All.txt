You see Chandli, dealing with the enemy is just like arm wrestling.                   *No matter how big, muscley, or hairy they are, you can overcome any foe with willpower and torque.                    *You get what I'm saying right boy?                                                                         
$Well, good to see you have a decent head on those shoulders.       *Now if you run into this "Devin" in school what are you going to do?

When somone offers oposition, simply force your will onto them until they submit   *Now if you run into this "Devin" at school what are you going to do?              
$Very good, I think you get what I'm trying to say. Do you think you've got what it takes to finish me and Devin off?                                                     
%You're a little hopeless Chandli. But hey, if you can beat me in a battle of wills, then I guess you get what I'm saying. *So, do you think you can beat me Chandli?
